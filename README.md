This program has an "old school" terminal window look.  I wrote it because I am learning python and wanted a project.  I play Wordle! a lot 
and have programmed in Microsoft PowerShell for some years - still at a novice level.  I would like to make more modern looking version of this
in pygame and encourage you to give me suggestions. I'm sure there is a lot of organizaing and streamlining that could make the program
easier to follow and not so many lines.  Any suggestions or rewrites encouraged.
