This program has an "old school" terminal window look.  I wrote it because I am learning python and wanted a project.  I play Wordle! a lot 
and have programmed in Microsoft PowerShell for some years - still at a novice level.  I would like to make more modern looking version of this
in pygame and encourage you to give me suggestions. I'm sure there is a lot of organizaing and streamlining that could make the program
easier to follow and not so many lines.  Any suggestions or rewrites encouraged.

The program is all in one file main.py.  The wordlist is an Excel CSV file for easy viewing and updating.  The program keeps track of
how many times a word is a winner.  I call this frequency or FREQ.
